        If you're here, it means you're in need of a good laugh
        And while you're usually the reason I'm smiling, let’s be real lowkey — **I'm the funny one.**
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean... remember the time I beat you 7–0 in FIFA?
        You had Real Madrid. I had Sunderland.
        You didn’t think it was funny — but that only makes it funnier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is, some of my favorite moments are the ones where we’re laughing, but we forget why.
        Your laugh is one of my favorite sounds — especially when I’m the reason for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if your cheeks aren’t hurting yet, just picture me talking about your FIFA skills cause that would crack me up...
        Or better yet, just come back to me — I’ll have better jokes ready.
