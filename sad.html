      Remember you are so loved & so valued from all of us. Know that if you need us, we'd be there in a heartbeat & we are always on your side.
        The feelings you are feeling at the moment are so valid but remember they are only temporary.<br><br>

        God is always looking ahead & you might be feeling sad or down now, but trust in him and find comfort in his plans.
        <br><br>

        Psalm 23:4- even though I walk through the vally of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your
        staff, they comfort me.<br> <br> <br>

        Love Skye
