      <p>
        If you’re doubting yourself right now, just remember
        You are capable. You are enough. And you don’t need to have everything figured out to be worthy of all the good things coming your way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve watched you do hard things. I’ve seen you push forward with grace, even when it felt heavy. You’re not weak for having doubts — you’re human. But don’t let those doubts speak louder than the truth about who you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are smart, strong, kind, and one of the most determined people I’ve ever met. You’re allowed to rest. You’re allowed to stumble. Just don’t ever forget who you are, and whose you are (Im sorry but call me shakespeare).
      </p>

      <p>
        And if you ever forget, I’ll remind you. Every single time.

      <p><strong>Isaiah 41:10</strong> — So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.</p>

      <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:7</strong> — For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</p>

      <p><strong>Psalm 139:14</strong> — I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.</p>
