        If you're reading this, it means your heart feels a little too quiet.
        And I want you to know — I'm thinking of you too.
        Missing someone like you is proof of how lucky I am to love you.
        Whether we're apart for an hour or a day, you are never far from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since our first sleepover, I’ve been missing you every single day.
        Not the kind of missing that hurts — but the kind that reminds me how safe and whole I feel when you’re around.
        Your absence only makes my love louder.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you miss me, just remember:
        I’m somewhere smiling because of you.
        And the next time I hold you, I’ll make up for every second we were apart.
