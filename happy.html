      <p>
        I just know you're smiling right now — and there's nothing I love more than that.
        Seeing you happy fills my heart in a way I can’t even describe.
        You deserve this joy and so much more.
        When you're happy, the whole world feels a little brighter.
        Don’t ever stop sharing that light.
      </p>

      <p>
        And you know something funny?
        If Mo hadn’t called me over that day, I honestly don’t know how I’d be feeling right now.
        But I know for sure I wouldn’t be this happy. That moment changed everything for me — because it brought me to you.

      <p><strong>Psalm 126:2</strong> — Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."</p>

      <p><strong>John 15:11</strong> — I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.</p>

      <p><strong>Nehemiah 8:10</strong> — Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.</p>
