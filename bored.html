        If you're bored, then clearly something is missing — probably me.
        But don’t worry, I've got you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could do something useful (like school work or marking)... OR you could pass time with me in spirit.
        Because honestly, being bored is just your heart's way of asking for something fun and familiar — like us.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's something random to shake it up
        And if that doesn't work, just text me and I'll be there.
      </p>

      <div class="bored-box">
        <button onclick="showIdea()">Click this for something to do</button>
        <p id="bored-output" class="caption"></p>
      </div>
    </div>
