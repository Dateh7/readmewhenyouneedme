      <p>
        For weeks, I didn’t know what to put in here. Most of our memories are of us just chilling — because, in your words, we’re “boring.” Not mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I realised… that’s the best part. I don’t have to do anything special to enjoy being with you. Your presence alone can change my entire day.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working on this, I kept trying to make everything perfect for your birthday. I wanted to take you out more, to “make” memories. But then I realised — we already have so many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, the go-karting win is up there for me. But my favourite memory? Us singing in the car to our song. That’s when I realised: I don’t need parties. I don’t need big events. I just need you.
