    <h1>Happy 21st Birthday, My Love</h1>

    <div class="message">
      <p>
        I didn’t want to just send a birthday message, so here it is — along with 17 other messages for you to carry with you, wherever you go.
        This took me weeks to curate, piece by piece, because you deserve something that lasts longer than a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the moment we met, I’ve thought about you every single day.
        You've made my life ten times better with your joy, your laugh, your kindness, and your weirdly perfect timing.
        You never fail to lift me, challenge me, or remind me what happiness feels like.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t think you realise how deeply you've changed my life.
        You’ve brought calm into my chaos. You’ve helped me slow down, breathe, and love more gently.
        Your attitude toward life helped me find a balance I had been searching for, for a long time — and I’ve never felt more like myself than when I’m with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        So for your 21st, I wanted to give you something different. Not a fancy gift, not a perfect thing —
        but something real. Something made with all the tiny pieces of love I’ve carried for you since the day we met.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Mo hadn’t called me over that day... I honestly don’t know how I’d feel right now.
        But I know I wouldn’t be this happy. So, along with Malachi, this is my gift to you —
        a small piece of my heart in scrapbook form.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open it anytime you need to feel loved, remembered, or wrapped up in something warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy Birthday, my "L word". Here’s to more pages, more memories, and more moments where I get to say,
        “This one’s for you.”
