        Hey you. I know some days feel heavier than others. You wake up, look at everything ahead of you, and just think, "How am I supposed to do all of this?"
      </p>

      <p>
        But I need you to remember something, you are one of the most capable, focused, determined people I know. You’ve overcome things before that were harder than this. You’ve kept going even when no one else saw the struggle. And look at you now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever you're working toward, be it school, your dreams, your healing, or just making it through the day. I’m proud of you. Always.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep going. Rest if you have to. Cry if you need. But don’t ever doubt what you’re made of.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ve got this. And I’ve got you.

      <h2 align = center>  For Your Strength</h2>

      <p><strong>Galatians 6:9</strong> — Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.</p>

      <p><strong>Isaiah 40:31</strong> — But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.</p>

      <p><strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> — I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</p>
