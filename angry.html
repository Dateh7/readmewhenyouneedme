      <p>
        So… you’re angry. <br>
        Maybe at someone else. Maybe at life. Maybe (and I’m hoping not)… at me?
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t really know what “angry you” looks like yet — and that’s probably a good thing.
        But when that day comes (and I know it will), I’ll be right here. Not to fight. Not to fix everything. Just to be there for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I might not always get it right, but I’ll always try to listen, to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        And until then — take a deep breath, drink some water, and maybe throw a pillow instead of your phone
        I love you, even when you're mad.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Proverbs 16:32</strong> — Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.</p>

      <p><strong>Colossians 3:13</strong> — Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.</p>
