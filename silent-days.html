      <p>
        If we haven’t spoken in a while, and you're here reading this — just know, I’ve been thinking about you.
        I miss you. And no matter the silence, I still care about you deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I’m the reason for the distance... I’m truly sorry. I never want to be the one who makes you feel alone or unsure.
        If I needed the space — it’s okay. I understand. And whatever it is I'll forgive you.
        Just give me a little time, and I’ll find my way back to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not perfect — but we are real. And even in the quiet, I haven’t and will never stop loving you.
        My heart has a spot only you can fill, and no silence can ever change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you're ready, come back to me — even if it's just with a “hey.”
        I’ll be here. Still yours. Always.
      </p>
