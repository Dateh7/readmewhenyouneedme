      <p>
        If you're overthinking about <strong>us</strong> — let me remind you: I'm not going anywhere. I'm here. Always. I don’t say that lightly. You don’t need to doubt my heart, or my commitment. I chose you. I keep choosing you. Every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're overthinking about <strong>school</strong> — stop and breathe for a moment. You are one of the hardest workers I have ever met. You push through everything with strength, even when you doubt yourself. No exam or assignment is bigger than your ambition. You are built for excellence. You just need to trust your preparation, and trust yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the world gets loud and your thoughts start to spiral, pause — and remember who you are. You’re more capable than you think. You’ve proven that time and time again. And no matter what, I believe in you. Always.

      <p><strong>Philippians 4:6–7</strong> — Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p><strong>Proverbs 3:5–6</strong> — Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.</p>
