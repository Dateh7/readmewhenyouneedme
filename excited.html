      <p>
        Whatever it is — big, small, silly, serious — I really want to hear about it.
        I want to see your eyes light up. I want to hear you yap and smile wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your joy is contagious. And honestly? It’s one of my favourite things about you.
        When you’re excited, the world feels lighter, brighter and better.
      </p>
      <p>
        So please don’t ever feel like you’re “too much” for being excited.
        Your passions, your wins, your weird little obsessions (matcha, even though I don't get it) — I love all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you aced a test, found a cute top at Zara, or just had a good cup of coffee — tell me.
        I want to be the first person you run to. I want to celebrate with you and celebrate you, every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because seeing you happy? That’s my favourite thing in the world.
