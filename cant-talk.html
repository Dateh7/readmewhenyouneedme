      <p>
        I know it's not always easy for you to talk about how you're feeling. And that’s okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need to have all the words. You don’t need to explain things perfectly. The fact that you're even trying — that you want to share — means so much to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will always be patient with you. I won't push. I won't rush you. I'm here to hold space for whatever you’re feeling, even if it comes out in pieces or pauses.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to carry everything by yourself. You can take your time. You can come to me when you're ready. And even in the silence — I’m listening, I’m present, and I’m with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I appreciate your heart, your effort, and your courage. You're never alone in this.
